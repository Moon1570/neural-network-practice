Perfect. Let‚Äôs design you a **hands-on, step-by-step neural network practice plan** assuming **2 hours per day**. The plan is structured for someone who wants to learn deeply by doing, starting from zero and moving toward building real-world projects.

I‚Äôll divide it into **4 phases**:

1. **Foundations (Math + Python basics)**
2. **Core Neural Networks (from scratch + PyTorch/TensorFlow)**
3. **Deep Learning Architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)**
4. **Projects + Research skills**

This is about **12 weeks (‚âà3 months)**, with flexibility. You‚Äôll spend **2 hours/day (‚âà14 hours/week)**.
